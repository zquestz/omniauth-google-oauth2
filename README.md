# OmniAuth Google OAuth2 Strategy

Strategy to authenticate with Google via OAuth2 in OmniAuth.

Get your API key at: https://code.google.com/apis/console/

For more details, read the Google docs: https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2

## Installation

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "omniauth-google-oauth2"
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

Here's an example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :google_oauth2, ENV["GOOGLE_KEY"], ENV["GOOGLE_SECRET"]
end
```

You can now access the OmniAuth Google OAuth2 URL: `/auth/google_oauth2`

## Configuration

You can configure several options, which you pass in to the `provider` method via a hash:

* `scope`: A comma-separated list of permissions you want to request from the user. See the [Google OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/) for a full list of available permissions. Caveats:
  * The `userinfo.email` and `userinfo.profile` scopes are used by default. By defining your own `scope`, you override these defaults. If you need these scopes, don't forget to add them yourself!
  * Scopes starting with `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/` do not need that prefix specified. So while you should use the smaller scope `books` since that permission starts with the mentioned prefix, you should use the full scope URL `https://docs.google.com/feeds/` to access a user's docs, for example.
* `prompt`: A space-delimited list of string values that determines whether the user is re-prompted for authentication and/or consent. Possible values are:
  * `none`: No authentication or consent pages will be displayed; it will return an error if the user is not already authenticated and has not pre-configured consent for the requested scopes. This can be used as a method to check for existing authentication and/or consent.
  * `consent`: The user will always be prompted for consent, even if he has previously allowed access a given set of scopes.
  * `select_account`: The user will always be prompted to select a user account. This allows a user who has multiple current account sessions to select one amongst them.

  If no value is specified, the user only sees the authentication page if he is not logged in and only sees the consent page the first time he authorizes a given set of scopes.

* `image_aspect_ratio`: The shape of the user's profile picture. Possible values are:
  * `original`: Picture maintains its original aspect ratio.
  * `square`: Picture presents equal width and height.

  Defaults to `original`.

* `image_size`: The size of the user's profile picture. The image returned will have width equal to the given value and variable height, according to the `image_aspect_ratio` chosen. Additionally, a picture with specific width and height can be request by setting this option to a hash with `:width` and `:height` as keys. If only `:width` or `:height` is specified, a picture whose width or height is closest to the requested size and requested aspect ratio will be returned. Defaults to the original width and height of the picture.

* `access_type`: Defaults to `offline`, so a refresh token is sent to be used when the user is not present at the browser. Can be set to `online`.

Here's an example of a possible configuration where the user is asked for extra permissions, the user is always prompted to select his account when logging in and the user's profile picture is returned as a thumbnail:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :google_oauth2, ENV["GOOGLE_KEY"], ENV["GOOGLE_SECRET"],
    {
      :scope => "userinfo.email, userinfo.profile, plus.me, http://gdata.youtube.com",
      :prompt => "select_account",
      :image_aspect_ratio => "square",
      :image_size => 50
    }
end
```

## Auth Hash

Here's an example of an authentication hash available in the callback by accessing `request.env["omniauth.auth"]`:

```ruby
{
    :provider => "google_oauth2",
    :uid => "123456789",
    :info => {
        :name => "John Doe",
        :email => "john@company_name.com",
        :first_name => "John",
        :last_name => "Doe",
        :image => "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/url/photo.jpg"
    },
    :credentials => {
        :token => "token",
        :refresh_token => "another_token",
        :expires_at => 1354920555,
        :expires => true
    },
    :extra => {
        :raw_info => {
            :id => "123456789",
            :email => "user@domain.example.com",
            :verified_email => true,
            :name => "John Doe",
            :given_name => "John",
            :family_name => "Doe",
            :link => "https://plus.google.com/123456789",
            :picture => "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/url/photo.jpg",
            :gender => "male",
            :birthday => "0000-06-25",
            :locale => "en",
            :hd => "company_name.com"
        }
    }
}
```
